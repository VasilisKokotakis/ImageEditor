# Photo Editing Framework with Python

Welcome to the Photo Editing Framework, an end-to-end solution for enhancing and transforming your images using Python. This comprehensive framework utilizes the powerful PIL library (Pillow) to provide a range of editing functionalities, ensuring that you can effortlessly enhance and modify your photo collection.

## Features

- **Sharpening and Black & White Conversion:** The framework employs the ImageFilter module to apply sharpening effects and converts images to grayscale using the 'L' mode. Additionally, it includes a rotation step for creative adjustments.

- **Contrast Enhancement:** With adjustable contrast levels, the framework allows you to fine-tune the visual appeal of your images. The example showcases a contrast enhancement with a factor of 1.5, providing a vibrant and dynamic look.

- **Extendable and Customizable:** The framework is designed to be easily extendable. Feel free to explore and incorporate additional edits according to your preferences. The documentation for the PIL library provides a comprehensive guide to more editing options ([Pillow Documentation](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)).

## Usage

1. **Image Input:** Place your unedited images in the designated `imgs` folder.
2. **Run the Script:** Execute the Python script, and the framework will process each image in the input folder, applying the specified edits.
3. **Edited Images:** The enhanced images will be saved in the `editedImgs` folder, retaining the original filenames with the "_edited" suffix.
